Mix in remaining 2 teaspoons vanilla. Transfer vanilla cream to a disposable pastry bag and cut a 1\/2-inch opening from tip.",
      "Step 9: Use the base of a large round piping tip, a small round cookie cutter, or a paring knife to cut a hole out of the top of each cake. Pipe vanilla cream into holes. Top with a small piece of removed cake to help seal cream inside. Freeze cakes while you make the glaze (at least 15 minutes).",
      "Step 10: Melt butter cubes, chocolate, and remaining 1 1\/2 teaspoons corn syrup in a double boiler or a heat-safe bowl set over simmering water, stirring occasionally, until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat; let cool 5 minutes. Stir before using.",
      "Step 11: Dip top of each cake into glaze, allowing excess to drip off; transfer to a wire rack. Let stand until glaze sets completely. If desired, decorate tops of cakes with remaining vanilla cream. Chill in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 4 days."

Pipe a layer of whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1 to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.\nCook\u2019s Note\nYou can use all-purpose flour in place of cake flour, if desired. The cupcakes won't turn out as light and fluffy, however. You can also use frozen strawberries in place of fresh.\nThe cupcakes are quite soft, but will be easier to handle when chilled. So keep them chilled as much as you can while working with them.\nFor best results, assemble these the same day you plan to serve them, and keep chilled until ready to serve. However, you can make the cupcakes and strawberry sauce a day or two in advance.\nI like to place the cupcakes carefully back onto their liners after assembling them--it just makes them a bit easier to pick up and eat"

Just be sure to continually scrape the sides of the processor bowl so everything combines completely.\nIf the dough isn't coming together easily, try adding in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to help it come together. If the dough is too sticky to roll into balls, place into the freezer until slightly chilled, then proceed with rolling.\nSweetened coconut may be used in place of unsweetened and pecans may be used in place of walnuts, if desired. Roll each bite in extra unsweetened coconut flakes, if desired.\nThe number of bites you get from this recipe will depend on how big you make them."

      "Step 1: For the focaccia: Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.",
      "Step 2: Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.",
      "Step 3: Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.",
      "Step 4: After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes.",
      "Step 5: At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.",
      "Step 6: For the toppings: Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.",
      "Step 7: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).",
      "Step 8: Pour about 1\/2 tablespoon of olive oil to a skillet and place over medium heat. Once shimmering, add onions and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add ground beef along with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook, breaking the meat up with a heat-safe spatula as it cooks. Cook until beef is nearly browned with just a few specks of pink remaining, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat and set aside to cool.",
      "Step 9: Once focaccia has risen for an hour and meat has cooled slightly, lightly drizzle the surface of the focaccia with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter cheese in an even layer. Dimple the surface again, then dollop meat and onions all over the surface.",
      "Step 10: Bake in the preheated oven until the focaccia and cheese are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.",
      "Step 11: Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes, then sprinkle chopped pickles all over before slicing and serving."

Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.\nBRIE GOLDMAN \/ FOOD STYLIST: ANNIE PROBST \/ PROP STYLIST: ADDELYN EVANS\nRecipe Tip\nTo prevent a soggy spanakopita, allow the spinach mixture to cool and then squeeze out as much liquid as possible before moving on to the next step. You can place the spinach in a fine sieve or clean cloth and press or squeeze out excess liquid, working over the sink.",
      "Step 4: Mix feta cheese, ricotta cheese, and eggs in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in spinach mixture. Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in the prepared baking pan, and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top and brush with olive oil. Repeat the process with two more sheets of phyllo dough; the sheets will overlap the pan.\nBRIE GOLDMAN \/ FOOD STYLIST: ANNIE PROBST \/ PROP STYLIST: ADDELYN EVANS\nExpert Tip\nOur Editorial Director Diana Moutsopoulos likes to sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of semolina flour over the last layer of phyllo before adding the filling. The semolina helps to absorb excess moisture, preventing sogginess and keeping the phyllo cripsy. If you don't have semolina you can use Cream of Wheat.",

Remove pot from heat, and stir in lemon zest and lemon juice. Pour mixture into a heat safe bowl, and place uncovered into the fridge to chill. (Once mixture is chilled and no longer condensing, you can then cover the bowl.)",

      "Step 4: Cupcakes: Sift together cake flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and nutmeg.",
      "Step 5: Beat butter, oil, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add in egg whites, vanilla, and almond extract, and beat mixture on medium-high speed for another 3 minutes. Add in half of flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream and milk; mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture; mix until just combined.",
      "Step 6: Pour batter into prepared cupcake pans, filling each liner no more than 2\/3 full. Bake one pan at a time, until tops of cupcakes spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes Chill cupcakes in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. This will make them easier to cut and fill.",
      "Step 7: Cream cheese whipped cream: Beat chilled cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt together until smooth. Add in 1\/2 cup cold heavy cream, and mix on low until mixture is smooth. Add in remaining heavy cream; beat on medium-high until mixture holds stiff peaks. If desired, place mixture into a piping bag fitted with an open star tip (such as a Wilton\u00ae 1M). Place piping bag in refrigerator until ready to use.",
      "Step 8: Remove cupcakes from refrigerator. Remove the liners and cut tops off cupcakes. Pipe a layer of whipped cream on bottom half of cupcakes; top with about 1 to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Place tops of cupcakes back on, and lightly press down to adhere. Pipe more whipped cream on top of cupcakes and top with another 1 to 2 teaspoons strawberry mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.\nCook\u2019s Note\nYou can use all-purpose flour in place of cake flour, if desired. The cupcakes won't turn out as light and fluffy, however. You can also use frozen strawberries in place of fresh.\nThe cupcakes are quite soft, but will be easier to handle when chilled. So keep them chilled as much as you can while working with them.\nFor best results, assemble these the same day you plan to serve them, and keep chilled until ready to serve. However, you can make the cupcakes and strawberry sauce a day or two in advance.\nI like to place the cupcakes carefully back onto their liners after assembling them--it just makes them a bit easier to pick up and eat"

Rotate the bowl a few inches and repeat about 10 or 12 times, then gather the dough into a ball as best you can, turning the smoothest side up. Cover the bowl, and let dough rest for 15 minutes.

Remove to a cooling rack; let cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then cut and serve.\nJOHN MITZEWICH\nChef's Note\nThe bottom of the pizza should be golden brown and crisp, but if it is not, place back on sheet pan, and place over a medium high flame, until you can hear the crust start to sizzle slightly. Rotate the pan so all parts of the bottom crust get toasted and turn golden brown. This is a great way to crisp up a crust, but be careful not to go too far and burn the dough."

Slice between each rib with a sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.\nCHEF JOHN\nChef's Notes\nHere\u2019s a trick for telling whether your ribs are done that I learned from an old pitmaster. During one of the bastings near the end of the cooking time, place a pair of tongs under the full length of the center rib, and gently lift the rack off the baking sheet. If the ends of the rack droop, the ribs are nearly done. If the rack remains stiff, the ribs need more cooking time, and if the rack breaks in the center and falls apart, they are overcooked.\nThe video shows an easy way to remove the membrane from the bone side of a rack of ribs, an optional step I rarely take, but I did for this recipe.\nFeel free to try other flavors of soda with this recipe, like root beer or ginger ale."

If pork is cut all the way to the cutting board, it will separate into 2 pieces and this recipe will not work.",
      "Step 2: Place butterflied pork on a piece of plastic wrap, and cover with another piece of plastic. Use a meat pounder to pound the pork to about 3\/16-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until needed.",
      "Step 3: Coarsely chop pistachios and set aside.",
      "Step 4: In a small bowl, combine mustard, garlic, maple syrup, salt, black pepper, and cayenne, and mix thoroughly with a spoon until combined.",
      "Step 5: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).",
      "Step 6: Remove pork from the refrigerator to a cutting board, one long side facing you. The pork will be an uneven shape at this point. To even it up more, slice a small piece off the pointed end, and place it over the gap on the wider end. Add a piece of plastic over the top, and pound with the meat pounder. The meat will adhere to itself, take on a more rectangular shape, and be easier to fill and roll evenly.",
      "Step 7: Spread mustard mixture evenly over the surface almost all the way to the edge on 3 sides, but leaving a couple inches of the edge furthest from you uncovered. Cover mustard evenly with breadcrumbs, and then with pistachios.",
      "Step 8: Roll pork up tightly, finishing with the seam at the bottom. Use kitchen string to tie pork every inch or so, trimming off any excess string.",
      "Step 9: Add vegetable oil to an oven-safe skillet, and set heat to medium-high. When oil is hot, add tied tenderloin and brown pork on all sides, turning often, about 4 minutes total.",
      "Step 10: Roast pork in the preheated oven in the skillet until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 16 to 20 minutes.",
      "Step 11: Remove skillet from the oven. Transfer pork onto a plate, loosely cover with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.",
      "Step 12: Meanwhile, for pan sauce, place skillet back on the stove over high heat; pour in rice wine vinegar and chicken broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, scraping bottom and sides of the pan with a spoon to help dissolve any caramelization.",
      "Step 13: Once about 75% of liquids have evaporated, and mixture is very slightly thickened, turn off heat and add cold butter. Keep butter moving by shaking the pan or stirring with a spoon until it disappears, and sauce is glossy and emulsified. Season with a pinch of salt and keep warm.",
      "Step 14: Snip the string off pork, then slice into about 1-inch thick pieces. Strain pan sauce over pork slices and garnish with fresh snipped chives to serve.\nJOHN MITZEWICH"

Slice between each rib with a sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.\nCHEF JOHN\nChef's Notes\nHere\u2019s a trick for telling whether your ribs are done that I learned from an old pitmaster. During one of the bastings near the end of the cooking time, place a pair of tongs under the full length of the center rib, and gently lift the rack off the baking sheet. If the ends of the rack droop, the ribs are nearly done. If the rack remains stiff, the ribs need more cooking time, and if the rack breaks in the center and falls apart, they are overcooked.\nThe video shows an easy way to remove the membrane from the bone side of a rack of ribs, an optional step I rarely take, but I did for this recipe.\nFeel free to try other flavors of soda with this recipe, like root beer or ginger ale."

More fish sauce can be added for a saltier, more intense version, but if you\u2019re new to using an Asian fish sauce be careful, and start slowly. You can always add more to the finished noodles. Same goes for the tamarind, and the spicy ingredients."
